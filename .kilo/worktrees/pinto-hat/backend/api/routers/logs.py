"""Router: GET /api/logs/stream   (Server-Sent Events)
           GET /api/logs/history  (recent buffered lines)

Streams real-time log output from all running subprocesses — backtest,
data download, optimizer, and stress-lab — to any connected SSE client.

SSE wire format
---------------
    retry: 3000\n\n                             (sent once on connect)
    data: {"message": "...", "ts": "..."}\n\n  (per log line)
    : keepalive\n\n                             (every 15 s when idle)

Connect with ``EventSource`` in a browser or any SSE-capable HTTP client.
Set ``Accept: text/event-stream`` if your client requires it explicitly.
